### About

[Jetpack Compose][4] is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. This library integrates with Compose to allow you to load images in your Compose apps with Glide in a performant manner. 


### Status

Glide's Compose integration is new as of 9-2022 and as a result is labeled as an experimental API. Please submit bugs if you encounter any and/or feature requests to [Glide's Github Issues][5]. We will try to minimize API churn, but at least while the Compose integration is experimental, there may be an occasional breaking change between versions.


### How do I include the Compose integration library?

The Compose integration doesn't include any components, so you don't need any changes to your `AppGlideModule` to use it.

Instead, just add a Gradle dependency on the Compose integration library:

```groovy
implementation "com.github.bumptech.glide:compose:1.0.0-alpha.1"
```

### 
Compose integration. See the [Dokka][13] page for detailed API documentation.


#### GlideImage

The primary integration point between Compose and Glide is `GlideImage`. `GlideImage` is meant to similarly to [Compose's Image][7] function except that it uses Glide to asynchronously load images. 

Simple use cases of GlideImage can include just a Model and a content description:

```
GlideImage(model = myUrl, contentDescription = getString(R.id.picture_of_cat))
```

You can supply a custom [`Modifier`][8] to customize how `GlideImage` is rendered:

```kotlin
GlideImage(
  model = myUrl,
  contentDescription = getString(R.id.picture_of_cat),
  modifier = Modifier.padding(padding).clickable(onClick = onClick).fillParentMaxSize(),
)
```

You can also provide the `alignment`, `contentScale`, `colorFilter`, and `alpha` parameters that have identical defaults and function identically to the same parameters in [Compose's Image][7].

To configure the Glide load, you can provide a `RequestBuilderTransformation` function. The function will be passed a `RequestBuilder` that already has `load()` called on it with your given model. You can then customize the request with any normal [Glide option][9]. The only exception is that Glide's `Transitions` are currently not supported:

```kotlin
GlideImage(
  model = myUrl,
  contentDescription = getString(R.id.picture_of_cat),
  modifier = Modifier.padding(padding).clickable(onClick = onClick).fillParentMaxSize(),
) {
   it
    .thumbnail(
      requestManager
      .asDrawable()
      .load(item.uri)
      .signature(signature)
      .override(THUMBNAIL_DIMENSION)
    )
    .signature(signature)
}
```


##### Sizing

As with Glide's View integration, Glide's Compose integration will attempt to determine the size of your Composable and use that to load an appropriately sized image. That can only be done efficiently if you provide a `Modifier` that restricts the size of the Composable. If Glide determines that either the width or the height of the Composable is unbounded, it will use `Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL`, which can lead to excessive memory usage.

Whenever possible, make sure you either set a `Modifier` with a bounded size or provide an [`override()`][10] size to your Glide request. In addition to saving memory, loads from the disk cache will also be faster if your size is smaller.

##### Transitions and State Changes

Currently Glide's Compose API does not explicitly support Glide's `Transition` class. If you'd find this functionality useful, please file or a plus one an [issue][5]. 

Similary while Glide's `placeholder`, `error` and `fallback` request options work and can be provided via GlideImage's `RequestBuilderTransform`, we do not currently support custom Composable functions for each of those states. Similarly please file or plus one an [issue][5].


#### GlideLazyListPreloader

GlideLazyListPreloader uses [Compose's `LazyListState`][11] to determine the direction the user is scrolling and preload images in the direction of scroll. Preloading, especially when used with relatively small image sizes in combination with [Glide's thumbnail API][12], can dramatically improve the UX of horiztonally or vertically scrolling UIs.

Using the preloader looks like this:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DeviceMedia(mediaStoreData: List<MediaStoreData>) {
  val state = rememberLazyListState()
  LazyRow(state = state) {
    items(mediaStoreData) { mediaStoreItem ->
      // Uses GlideImage to display a MediaStoreData object
      MediaStoreView(mediaStoreItem, requestManager, Modifier.fillParentMaxSize())
    }
  }

   GlideLazyListPreloader(
    state = state,
    data = mediaStoreData,
    size = THUMBNAIL_SIZE,
    numberOfItemsToPreload = 15,
    fixedVisibleItemCount = 2,
  ) { item, requestBuilder ->
    requestBuilder.load(item.uri).signature(item.signature())
  }
}

@Composable
fun MediaStoreView(item: MediaStoreData, requestManager: RequestManager, modifier: Modifier) {
  val signature = item.signature()

  GlideImage(
    model = item.uri,
    contentDescription = item.displayName,
    modifier = modifier,
  ) {
    it
      // This thumbnail request exactly matches the request in GlideLazyListPreloader
      // so that the preloaded image can be used here and display more quickly than 
      // the primary request.
      .thumbnail(
        requestManager
          .asDrawable()
          .load(item.uri)
          .signature(signature)
          .override(THUMBNAIL_DIMENSION)
      )
      .signature(signature)
  }
}
```

`state` is a [`LazyListState`][11] that you can obtain using standard Compose APIs. `data` is the List of model objects that you're displaying. `size` is the size of the image that you want to preload. This must exactly match at least one size provided to a Request or thumbnail Request used by `GlideImage` to display the item. `numberOfItemsToPreload` is total number of items you want to urI to keep in memory ahead of the user's position as they scroll. You may need some performance testing to find the right balance. Too high of a number and you may exceed the memory cache size. Too low and you won't be able to keep up with scrolling. `fixedVisibleItemCoutn` is a guess of how many items you think will typically be visible on the screen at once.
Finally you can provide a `PreloadRequestBuilderTransform`, which will give you one object from the `data` list at a time to create a Glide request for. `size` will be applied for you automatically via Glide's override API. So you only need to specify any additional components of the load that are required to make the request exactly match the load (or at least one thumbnail load) in the corresponding `GlideImage`.

As with much of Glide's Compose API, there are likely to be some API changes to this class. In particular we'd like to simplify the process of specifying the request so that the request options are not duplicated, once in `GlideLazyListPreloader` and again in `GlideImage`.
