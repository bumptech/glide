### RequestOptions
Most options in Glide can be applied using the [``RequestOptions``][1] class and the [``apply()``][2] method.

Use request options to apply (among others):

* Placeholders
* Transformations
* Caching Strategies
* Component specific options, like encode quality, or decode ``Bitmap`` configurations.

For example, to apply a [``CenterCrop``][3] [``Transformation``][4], you'd use the following:

```java
import static com.bumptech.glide.request.RequestOptions.centerCropTransform;

Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(url)
    .apply(centerCropTransform(context))
    .into(imageView);
```

Statically importing methods from ``RequestOptions`` allows for a simple fluent API.

If you'd like to share options consistently in loads across different parts of your app, you can also instantiate a new ``RequestOptions`` object and pass it in to each load:

```java
RequestOptions cropOptions = new RequestOptions().centerCrop(context);
...
Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(url)
    .apply(cropOptions)
    .into(imageView);
```

[``apply()``][2] can be called multiple times, so ``RequestOptions`` can be composed. If two ``RequestOptions`` objects contain conflicting settings, the last ``RequestOptions`` applied to the load will win.

### TransitionOptions

[TransitionOptions][5] determine what will happen when your requested load completes.

Use ``TransitionOptions`` to apply:

* View fade in
* Cross fade from the placeholder
* No transition

Without a transition, your image will pop into place, immediately replacing the previous image. To avoid the sudden change, you can fade in your view, or cross fade between ``Drawables`` using ``TransitionOptions``.

For example, to apply a cross fade:

```java
import static com.bumptech.glide.load.resource.drawable.DrawableTransitionOptions.withCrossFade;

Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(url)
    .transition(withCrossFade())
    .into(view);
```

Unlike ``RequestOptions``, ``TransitionOptions`` are type specific and are tied to the type of resource you ask Glide to load.

As a result, if you request a ``Bitmap``, you will need to use [BitmapTransitionOptions][6], rather than [DrawableTransitionOptions][7]. As a result, if you request a ``Bitmap``, you may need to do a simple fade in, rather than a cross fade.

### RequestBuilder

[RequestBuilder][8] is the backbone of the request in Glide and is responsible for bringing your options together with your requested url or model to start a new load.

Use ``RequestBuilder`` to specify:

* The type of resource you want to load (Bitmap, Drawable etc)
* The url/model you want to load the resource from
* The view you want to load the resource into
* Any ``RequestOption`` object(s) you want to apply
* Any ``TransitionOption`` object(s) you want to apply
* Any [``thumbnail()``][9] you want to load.

You obtain a ``RequestBuilder`` with each call to ``Glide.with()``:

```java
RequestBuilder<Drawable> requestBuilder = Glide.with(fragment);
```

#### Picking a resource type

``RequestBuilders`` are specific to the type of resource they will load. By default you get a Drawable RequestBuilder.  You can change the requested type using ``as...`` methods. For example, if you call ``asBitmap()`` you will get a ``Bitmap``
``RequestBuilder`` instead:

```java
RequestBuilder<Bitmap> requestBuilder = Glide.with(fragment).asBitmap();
```

#### Applying RequestOptions

As mentioned above, you apply ``RequestOptions`` with the [``apply()``][2] method and ``TransitionOptions`` with the [``transition()``][10] method:

```java
RequestBuilder<Drawable> requestBuilder = Glide.with(fragment);
requestBuilder.apply(requestOptions);
requestBuilder.transition(transitionOptions);
```

RequestBuilders can also be re-used to start multiple loads:

```java
RequestBuilder<Drawable> requestBuilder =
        Glide.with(fragment)
            .asDrawable()
            .apply(requestOptions);

for (int i = 0; i < numViews; i++) {
   ImageView view = viewGroup.getChildAt(i);
   String url = urls.get(i);
   requestBuilder.load(url).into(view);
}
```
