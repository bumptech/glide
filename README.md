Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media
decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs. Glide includes a flexible API
that allows developers to plug in to almost any network stack. By default Glide uses a custom `HttpUrlConnection` based
stack, but also includes utility libraries plug in to Google's Volley project or Square's OkHttp library instead.

Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is
also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.

Download
--------
For detailed instructions and requirements, see Glide's [download and setup docs page][28].

You can download a jar from GitHub's [releases page][1].

Or use Gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  google()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.9.0'
  annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.9.0'
}
```

Or Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.bumptech.glide</groupId>
  <artifactId>glide</artifactId>
  <version>4.9.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.bumptech.glide</groupId>
  <artifactId>compiler</artifactId>
  <version>4.9.0</version>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

For info on using the bleeding edge, see the [Snapshots][17] docs page.

ProGuard
--------
Depending on your ProGuard (DexGuard) config and usage, you may need to include the following lines in your proguard.cfg (see the [Download and Setup docs page][25] for more details):

```pro
-keep public class * implements com.bumptech.glide.module.GlideModule
-keep public class * extends com.bumptech.glide.module.AppGlideModule
-keep public enum com.bumptech.glide.load.ImageHeaderParser$** {
  **[] $VALUES;
  public *;
}

# for DexGuard only
-keepresourcexmlelements manifest/application/meta-data@value=GlideModule
```

How do I use Glide?
-------------------
Check out the [documentation][20] for pages on a variety of topics, and see the [javadocs][3].

For Glide v3, see the [wiki][2].

Simple use cases will look something like this:

```java
// For a simple view:
@Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  ...
  ImageView imageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.my_image_view);

  Glide.with(this).load("http://goo.gl/gEgYUd").into(imageView);
}

// For a simple image list:
@Override public View getView(int position, View recycled, ViewGroup container) {
  final ImageView myImageView;
  if (recycled == null) {
    myImageView = (ImageView) inflater.inflate(R.layout.my_image_view, container, false);
  } else {
    myImageView = (ImageView) recycled;
  }

  String url = myUrls.get(position);

  Glide
    .with(myFragment)
    .load(url)
    .centerCrop()
    .placeholder(R.drawable.loading_spinner)
    .into(myImageView);

  return myImageView;
}
```

Status
------
Version 4 is now released and stable. Updates are released periodically with new features and bug fixes.

Comments/bugs/questions/pull requests are always welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md][5] on how to report issues.

Compatibility
-------------

 * **Minimum Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires a minimum API level of 14.
 * **Compile Android SDK**: Glide v4 requires you to compile against API 26 or later.

 If you need to support older versions of Android, consider staying on [Glide v3][14], which works on API 10, but is not actively maintained.

 * **OkHttp 3.x**: There is an optional dependency available called `okhttp3-integration`, see the [docs page][23].
 * **Volley**: There is an optional dependency available called `volley-integration`, see the [docs page][24].
 * **Round Pictures**: `CircleImageView`/`CircularImageView`/`RoundedImageView` are known to have [issues][18] with `TransitionDrawable` (`.crossFade()` with `.thumbnail()` or `.placeholder()`) and animated GIFs, use a [`BitmapTransformation`][19] (`.circleCrop()` will be available in v4) or `.dontAnimate()` to fix the issue.
 * **Huge Images** (maps, comic strips): Glide can load huge images by downsampling them, but does not support zooming and panning `ImageView`s as they require special resource optimizations (such as tiling) to work without `OutOfMemoryError`s.

Build
-----
Building Glide with gradle is fairly straight forward:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bumptech/glide.git
cd glide
./gradlew jar
```

**Note**: Make sure your *Android SDK* has the *Android Support Repository* installed, and that your `$ANDROID_HOME` environment
variable is pointing at the SDK or add a `local.properties` file in the root project with a `sdk.dir=...` line.

Samples
-------
Follow the steps in the [Build](#build) section to set up the project and then:

```shell
./gradlew :samples:flickr:run
./gradlew :samples:giphy:run
./gradlew :samples:svg:run
./gradlew :samples:contacturi:run
```
You may also find precompiled APKs on the [releases page][1].

Development
-----------
Follow the steps in the [Build](#build) section to setup the project and then edit the files however you wish.
[Android Studio][26] cleanly imports both Glide's source and tests and is the recommended way to work with Glide.

To open the project in Android Studio:

1. Go to *File* menu or the *Welcome Screen*
2. Click on *Open...*
3. Navigate to Glide's root directory.
4. Select `setting.gradle`

For more details, see the [Contributing docs page][27].

Getting Help
------------
To report a specific problem or feature request, [open a new issue on Github][5]. For questions, suggestions, or
anything else, email [Glide's discussion group][6], or join our IRC channel: [irc.freenode.net#glide-library][13].
